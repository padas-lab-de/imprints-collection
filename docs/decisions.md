# Lead record

## In flight
- E4-fetch-yield-baseline: small sample done (1,000 alphabetical hosts `www.rod…`, ~100 s): imprint_found 437, imprint_not_found 382, host_not_found 170, no_valid_html_tree 6, filtered 5 -> 437/819 reachable = 53.4% (paper: 58.2%). Output datasets/E4/small_sample/. NOW RUNNING: random 20k sample (`shuf --random-source=<(yes 20261023)` from seed_hosts.txt.gz -> datasets/E4/random20k_seed_hosts.txt), log results/logs/E4-fetch-random20k.log, output moved to datasets/E4/random20k/ on finish. Then: break down imprint_not_found by TLD and cause.

## Lead actions
- 2026-10-23 E2 done (see status.md). Created docs/status.md.
- 2026-10-23 Merged e1-eval-harness (oracle 100%; 28 tests pass after fixing duplicate dev-deps table). Added Qwen3.8-27B/Gemma4-31B to config with per-model extra_body; Qwen3.8 needs reasoning_effort=none (else 6/20 topic calls hit the 2,000-token limit). Note: scoring treats all-blank addresses as failed; must change to a valid 'no address' answer once D8 negatives exist.
- 2026-10-23 Merged d3-minimal-fixes (17 smoke tests pass; vllm optional; python <3.13; README paths fixed; CLAUDE.md added).
- 2026-10-23 Appended MODEL_API_ENDPOINT/MODEL_API_KEY (interpolates INNKUBE_API_KEY)/GEOCODING_API_ENDPOINT to .env; local Photon on :2322 answers.
- 2026-10-23 Paper finding: 3,226,331 imprints -> 3,225,347 'extracted addresses' (99.97%); Address schema has only required fields, so the LLM cannot answer 'no address' -> precision unknown. Probe (gemma4-31b-it, qwen38-27b, one address-free imprint): both return all-empty fields, so no forced hallucination in the clear case; CONFIRMED src/ic/cli/stats.py:126 counts every record with an 'address' key, incl. all-empty ones -> paper's 3,225,347 'extracted address' counts responses, not addresses; recompute from old results (needs A2 path).
- 2026-10-23 Drafted docs/annotation_guideline.md v0.1 for D8 (awaits user review).
- 2026-10-23 Gold audit: 987/1000 items have all address fields verbatim in text; all 1000 have exactly one address, 999 'Deutschland'; no negatives, no multi-address, no AT/CH.
- 2026-10-23 Orientation: found gold standard unused by code; gold topic labels (11 English top-level) differ from model label space (796 German categories); gold has no empty-address cases; deps/README drift.
